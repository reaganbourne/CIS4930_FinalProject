# CIS4930_FinalProject
Smart recipe recommender and meal planner project for CIS4930 group 7.

PROJECT CODE: (Total 50 points)
1. Data Input and Output: (5 points)
- The application should read a list of available ingredients from a CSV file. Each entry should
include the ingredient name, quantity, and unit.
- It should read user preferences and nutritional goals from a configuration file (e.g., JSON or
YAML).
- The application should write a meal plan and shopping list to a text file.

2. Algorithm Development: (10 points)
- Implement an algorithm to recommend recipes based on available ingredients and user
preferences.
- Develop a meal planning algorithm that creates a weekly meal plan, ensuring nutritional
balance and variety.
- Create a shopping list generator that identifies additional ingredients needed for the selected
recipes.

3. Nutritional Analysis: (10 points)
- Analyze the nutritional content of the recommended recipes to ensure they align with
user-defined nutritional goals.
- Provide a summary of the nutritional content of the weekly meal plan.

4. User Interaction: (7 points)
- Implement a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user
interaction.
- Allow users to input or update their dietary preferences and nutritional goals.

5. Testing: (10 points)
- Write unit tests for the recipe recommendation and meal planning algorithms.
- Include tests for file reading and writing operations to verify data integrity.

6. Documentation: (8 points)
- Provide a README file with clear instructions on how to set up, run, and use the application.
- Include comments and documentation within the code to explain the logic and design
decisions.
